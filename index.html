    This page tests the XHR pipeline.
    </p>

    <p>
    The pipeline works like this:
    </p>

    <p>
    When making ajax calls, calls are not fired until next tick (setTimeout 10ms)
    Therefore, any other calls being made meanwhile, will be stocked, and calls will be batched
    </p>

    <p>
    Each call gets an ID that the endpoint is expected to return
    </p>

    <p>
    The server must process calls in the received order. It's free to return some calls early should it want to.
    The client then opens up a new long-poll to the pipeline, where the server can put the next round of calls
    </p>

    <button id="fire">Fire 5 calls</button>
    <ol id="list"></ol>
